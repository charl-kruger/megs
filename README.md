# Azure App Service Deployment Tutorial MCP Server

This MCP server interacts as a step-by-step tutorial for deploying to Azure App Service using remote MCP tools (no authentication required).

## Features

- Guides user through every step: project setup, prerequisites, resource group creation, plan setup, app deploy, and validation
- Works with Cloudflare's AI Playground, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Cursor, etc.
- Easily extend with more steps or deeper automation

## Deploy on Cloudflare Workers

[![Deploy to Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/your-repo-here)
